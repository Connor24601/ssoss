# Streaming Service Operating System Substitute
The goal of this project is to make a universal app (web, desktop, phone) that can be used safely with internal hosting and can act as a content wrapper, whether that be music, video, games, web browser, etc.
While this is very ambitious, this is a long term open source project, and scope changes are expected as development progresses.
